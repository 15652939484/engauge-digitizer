Steps to build and run engauge executable:
------------------------------------------
These steps build and run the standard engauge executable for digitizing data.

1) Install open source version 5 of the Qt toolkit. This is probably
   available for your operating systems as a source tarball, or many packages.
   If there is a development version of qt5, that should be installed as 
   a minimum

     --Package(s)--     --Comment--
     *qt5-dev*          Qt version 5 toolkit for building engauge

2) Install package dependencies using your package manager. Different packages
   may be substituted, or additional packages added, according to the feedback
   supplied in step #3:

     --Package(s)--     --Comment--
     libfftw3-dev       For computing fourier transforms. Tested with 3.3.3-7
     liblog4cpp-dev     For logging. Tested with 1.0.4
     libpng12-dev       For png image files (optional)
     libjpeg-dev        For jpeg image files (optional)

3) Run qmake on this file to generate make files. The qmake executable will
   display what functionality will, and what functionality will not, be 
   included in engauge as a function of the currently installed packages.

     > qmake engauge.pro

4) Build the executable using the make files from the previous step:

     > make

5) Generate the help files

     > ../help/build

6) Run engauge

     > ../bin/engauge

Steps to build engauge test executables and perform tests
---------------------------------------------------------
These steps build and test engauge.

1) Verify the standard version of engauge executable can be built and run

2) Build and test. Every line PASS/FAIL line should say PASS

     > ./build_and_run_all_tests

Steps to generate doxygen documentation
---------------------------------------
This generates doxygen documentation

1) Run doxygen

     > doxygen

2) Open engauge6/doc/doxygen/html/index.html in your browser

Steps to generate a software metrics report
-------------------------------------------
This generates doxygen documentation

1) Run cccc

     > docccc
