Debian Distributions
--------------------
Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu and Kubuntu, do not currently offer the newest Engauge Digitizer as 
packages (although this will hopefully change soon).

The Debian installer included in this release has been tested in 32 and 64 bit Kubuntu and Knoppix.

Red Hat Distributions
---------------------
Red Hat-based distributions, such as Fedora and Centos, offer the newest Engauge Digitizer as packages.

Windows
-------
The Windows MSI installer included in this release has been tested in Windows XP and Windows 8. This installer
is recommended when installing in a user account with administrative rights, since it creates shortcuts and
can be managed through the Control Panel.

The Windows ZIP file included in this release has been tested in Windows XP and Windows 7. After unzipping the
files into a directory, clicking on the engauge.exe executable file runs Engauge Digitizer. Installing from this zip file
is the only option when working in a user account without administrative rights (since the MSI installer cannot be used).
